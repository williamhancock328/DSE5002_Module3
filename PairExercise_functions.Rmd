## Creating your own functions

We have been using function of various types regularly so far.

Many of the libraries we use are simply collections of useful functions

Functions have

- a name

- input variables, values the user sends to the function
   -some variables have default values, which are values they
     take on unless the user sends them a different value

-one output variable
  -R is slightly odd in that it has only one output variable allowed, most
     languages allow many.  We can use a list or a dataframe, or other
     structure if we want or need to include a lot of different information
     in a return variable

Most languages have functions,  R and Lisp use them extensively.

I build complex analyses as a series of functions that carry out the steps I 
need.   There are a number of advantages to this:

1.) I can test each function, one by one, to be sure it is correct.

2.) My testing is done on small pieces of code, not long ones.

3.) The functions are modular, I can re-use them again later, or create
     variations on them for other problems.
    
4.) Working on a team,  different team members can be assigned to create and
    test different functions, so it is easy to split up the work.
 
     
## Example

Here is a function that raises some input value x to a power n, where
we are inputting x and n

the name is x2power, with inputs x and n

here is the declaration syntax

```{R}
x2power<-function(x,n)
{
  # this is the function x2Power, that raises an input value x to the input 
  # power n
  # written by HD Sheets, 6/24/2024 for DSE5002
  y=x^n
  return(y)
}
```

We use a function by calling it

```{R}
x2power(3,2)
```

## *Action Required*

Write your self a function that takes in three variables, a, b, and c
and returns (a+b)/c

```{r}
abc<-function(a,b,c)
{
  res=(a+b)/c
  return(res)
}
```

```{r}
abc(2,2,2)
```


## Default values

In the declaration line,  we can set default values for the variable

If the user does not input a value, the function will

```{R}
x2power<-function(x,n=2)
{
  # this is the function x2Power, that raises an input value x to the input 
  # power n
  # written by HD Sheets, 6/24/2024 for DSE5002
  # updated on 6/24/2024 to include a default value on n of 2
  
  y=x^n
  return(y)
}

x2power(4)
```

## Error trapping

It is a wise idea to check that the function has received valid
input data.

It there is an error, the function should tell you why and then return some
value that indicates an error.

It is common to return -1 or NULL to indicate an error

```{R}
x2power<-function(x,n=2)
{
  # this is the function x2Power, that raises an input value x to the input 
  # power n
  # written by HD Sheets, 6/24/2024 for DSE5002
  # updated on 6/24/2024 to include a default value on n of 2, HDS
  # further updated on 6/24/2024 to include some error trapping
  
  if(!is.numeric(x))
  {
    cat("Please enter only numeric values of x \n")
    return(NULL)
  }
  if(!is.numeric(n))
  {
     cat("Please enter only numeric values of n \n")
     return(NULL)
  }
  if(length(n)>1)
  {
     cat("Please enter a scalar value for n \n")
     return(NULL)
  } 
  
  
  y=x^n
  return(y)
}

x2power(4)
x2power("bob","37")
x2power(1:5,4:7)
```

## *Action Required*

Add some basic error trapping to the function you wrote.

Make sure c is not zero

```{R}
abc<-function(a,b,c)
{
  if(c==0)
  {
    cat("Please enter a number greater than zero. \n")
    return(NULL)
  }
  
  res=(a+b)/c
  return(res)
}
```

```{r}
abc(2,2,0)
```

## Do you really have to write extensive error trapping?

If it is a function only you will ever use, and you don't plan on using it 
constantly or sharing it, no, you can ship error trapping.

Never skip documenting it though!   Failure to document it means you
will rewrite it again later....


#Returning multiple variables

We can use a list or a dataframe to "pack" multiple values into a single
variable

```{r}

critical_KPI<-function(x,y,z)
{
  #example of returning two variables from a function, HDS 6/24/2024
  kpi_one=x/y
  kpi_two=(x^2+z)/sqrt(y)
  
  my_output_list=data.frame(kpi1=kpi_one,kpi2=kpi_two)
  return(my_output_list)
}

my_res=critical_KPI(2,3,4)

my_res$kpi1
my_res$kpi2

```

## Variable Scope

It is not uncommon to assign variable within a function.

These values are not visible outside the function, and don't alter
values in the workspace.   This protects your variables from unexpected
changes when using a function

```{R}
a=5
my_function_a<-function(x)
{
  #demonstration of variable scope, part a
  # HDS, 6/24/2024
  
  # define a local varialbe a that is only used in the function
  a=2
  y=a*x
  return(y)
}

#let's check the value of a
print(a)
# now run the function
z=my_function_a(5)
print(z)

# did the variable a in the workspace change?
print(a)

```

This is good!

Running the function didn't alter my variable a in the workspace, so if
I was using "a" for some other use in the workspace, calling the function 
wouldn't produce odd results.

But...

Functions can inherit values from levels "above" them,

So a function can inherit a value from the workspace

```{R}

b=2

my_function_b<-function(x)
{
  y=x^b
}

print(b)
z=my_function_b(6)
print(z)
print(b)

```

Notice that b is not defined in the function to be 2,   the function just
uses the b value from the next "level" up in the system.

With this feature you can do some cool things, but it is very unpredictable!

If you need to use variable inheritance, define a function within a function

```{r}

c=2

my_function_c<-function(x)                  #outer function
{
  c=3
  
  my_inner_function<-function(x)           #defined within my_function_c
  {
    y=c*x
    return(y)
  }
  
  youter=my_inner_function(x)
  return(youter)
}

print(c)                                      # c value in the workspace
z=my_function_c(6)                            # inner function uses value defined
                                              # in my_function_c
print(z)
print(c)


```

The scope control in R is not typical,   most languages protect variables
more carefully than this.

Try to avoid using variables from outside a function scope,  it can generate
errors that are very hard to locate and eliminate.

R has ways to change variables that are out of scope within a function, so that
a function could alter a variable in the workspace.

Just don't do this.
